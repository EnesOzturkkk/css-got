        <p><span>• A mind needs books as a sword needs a whetstone, if it is to keep its edge.</span>
            • That's what I do, I drink and I know things.
            • Never forget what you are, for surely the world will not. Make it your strength. Then it can never be your weakness. Armor yourself in it, and it will never be used to hurt you.
            • It's not easy being drunk all the time. If it were, everyone would do it.
            • A very small man can cast a very large shadow.
            • The more people you love, the weaker you are.
            • When you play the game of thrones, you win or you die. There is no middle ground.
            • My brother has his sword, King Robert has his warhammer, and I have my mind... and a mind needs books as a sword needs a whetstone, if it is to keep its edge. That's why I read so much, Jon Snow.
            • If you're going to be a cripple, it's better to be a rich cripple.
            • Love is the death of duty.
            • It's easy to mock a man when you're safe behind a wall.
            • The greatest fools are often overconfident.
            • I am a Lannister. We do not act like fools.
            • The future is not some grand battle, it's a thousand tiny victories and defeats, and the only way to see it is to live it.
            • Sometimes, a man's biggest strength is his biggest weakness.
            • Power is a curious thing... It's like a shadow on the wall. It's not real, but it's where people are looking. And when they look, they listen. 
            • Death is so terribly final, while life, ah, life is full of possibilities.
            • I have a tender spot in my heart for cripples, bastards and broken things.
            • I try to know as many people as I can. You never know who you'll need.
            • I wish I were the monster you think I am.
            • Justice? You've come to the wrong place.
            • Never forget what you are, for surely the world will not. Make it your strength. Then it can never be your weakness. Armor yourself in it, and it will never be used to hurt you.
            • The gods have no mercy, that's why they're gods.
            • It's hard to put a leash on a dog once you've put a crown on its head.
            • When I was a boy, I dreamt of being a great knight, like Ser Barristan Selmy. Then I grew up and realized I was a cripple.
            • You love your children. It's your one redeeming quality. That and your cheekbones.
            • I'm not trying to be witty. I'm trying to be accurate.
            • Lannisters don't act like fools? Are you sure? I've seen you act like a fool many times, brother.
            • I'm a monster, and a pervert. And I like it.
            • It's a long way from the privy to the Iron Throne.

            • Winter is coming.
            • The man who passes the sentence should swing the sword.
            • If you would take a man's life, you owe it to him to look into his eyes and hear his final words. And if you cannot bear to do that, then perhaps the man does not deserve to die. A ruler who hides behind paid executioners soon forgets what death is.
            • When the snows fall and the white winds blow, the lone wolf dies, but the pack survives.
            • Can a man still be brave if he's afraid?" "That is the only time a man can be brave.
            • You think my life is some precious thing to me? That I would trade my honor for a few more years... of what? You grew up with actors. You learned their craft and you learnt it well. But I grew up with soldiers. I learned to die a long time ago.
            • Robert was the true steel. Stannis is pure iron, hard and unbendable and brittle, and Renly is copper, bright and shiny and of little worth.
            • There's a saying in the North. 'The gods look out for fools and children.
            • We all have our days of reckoning.
            • Fear cuts deeper than swords.
            • What if I fall? +You won't. -How do you know? +Because you're a Stark.
            • I am Eddard Stark, Lord of Winterfell and Warden of the North. I come to you in peace, in the name of the King.
            • My father taught me that it was wrong to lie.
            • A madman sees what he sees.
            • The gods have a purpose for you, Bran.
            • Know the men who follow you and let them know you. Don't ask your men to die for a stranger.
            • I have made more mistakes than you can possibly imagine, but that was not one of them.
            • I would not dishonor Robert's last hours by shedding blood in his halls and dragging frightened children from their beds.
            • A lord may love the men that he commands, he could hear his lord father saying, but he cannot be a friend to them. One day he may need to sit in judgment on them, or send them forth to die.
            • Only a fool would trust Littlefinger
            • A man is not a man until he knows how to die.
            • I am the King's Hand. I have sworn an oath.

        <p>
            • First lesson: stick 'em with the pointy end.
            • My watch has ended.
            • I do know some things.
            • The more you give a king, the more he wants.
            • When enough people make false promises, words stop meaning anything. Then there are no more answers, only better and better lies.
            • I'm not asking you to forget your dead. I'll never forget mine. I lost 50 brothers the night that Mance attacked the Wall. But I'm asking you to think about your children now.
            • The Long Night is coming, and the dead come with it. No clan can stop them. The Free Folk can't stop them, the Night's Watch can't stop them, and all the southern kings can't stop them! Only together. All of us.
            • If I fall, don't bring me back.
            • We are here to say goodbye to our brothers and sisters. To our fathers and mothers. To our friends, our fellow men and women who set aside their differences to fight together... and die together, so the others might live.
            • They were born on the wrong side of the Wall. Doesn't make them monsters.
            • I am the sword in the darkness. I am the watcher on the walls. I am the shield that guards the realms of men.
            • We look up at the same stars and see such different things.
            • Sometimes there is no happy choice, only one less grievous than the others.
            • You have the numbers. But the true enemy won't wait out the storm. He brings the storm.
            • My father taught me big men fall just as quick as little ones if you put a sword through their hearts.
            • If you use them to melt castles and burn cities, you're no different.
            • Love is the death of duty.
            • I never wanted it.
            • The dead are coming. You don't have to believe in the Night King, but you have to believe in the dead. Because they're real.
            • There's no time for games. We're fighting for our lives.
            • Thousands of men don't need to die. Only one of us. Let's end this the old way.
            • You are a Stark. You may not have my name, but you have my blood.

        <p>
            • I will take what is mine with fire and blood.
            • Dracarys.
            • I am Daenerys Stormborn of the House Targaryen, of the blood of Old Valyria. I am the dragon's daughter, and I swear to you that those who would harm you will die screaming.
            • Fire cannot kill a dragon.
            • No one will take my dragons.
            • A queen who trusts no one is as foolish as a queen who trusts everyone.
            • I'm not going to stop the wheel. I'm going to break the wheel.
            • Yes, all men must die, but we are not men.
            • The next time you raise a hand to me will be the last time you have hands.
            • I am no ordinary woman. My dreams come true.
            • They can live in my new world, or they can die in their old one.
            • I will answer injustice with justice.
            • I was born to rule the Seven Kingdoms. And I will.
            • Slay the masters, slay the soldiers, slay every man who holds a whip, but harm no child! Strike the chains off every slave you see!
            • I am the blood of the dragon. I must be strong. I must have fire in my eyes when I face them, not tears.
            • I am not your little princess.
            • So many men have tried to kill me, I don't remember all their names. I have been sold like a broodmare. I've been chained and betrayed, raped, and defiled. Do you know what kept me standing through all those years in exile? Faith. Not in any gods. Not in myths and legends. In myself. In Daenerys Targaryen.
            • My reign has just begun.
            • You are small men. None of you are fit to lead the Dothraki. But I am. So I will.
            • The world hadn't seen a dragon in centuries until my children were born. The Dothraki hadn't crossed the sea. Any sea. They did for me.
            • Lannister, Targaryen, Baratheon, Stark, Tyrell – they're all just spokes on a wheel. This one's on top, then that one's on top, and on and on it spins, crushing those on the ground.
            • I will not let those I have freed slide back into chains. I will not sail for Westeros… I will do what queens do. I will rule.
            • He was no dragon. Fire cannot kill a dragon.
            • You're both here to advise me. I value your advice, but if you ever question me in front of strangers again, you'll be advising someone else. Is that understood? 
            • My love, when the sun rises in the west and sets in the east, when the seas go dry and mountains blow in the wind like leaves. When my womb quickens again, and I bear a living child. Then you will return, my sun-and-stars, and not before.
            • Mercy is a queen's strength. But often, it is her downfall as well.
            • The Iron Throne is mine, and I will take it.
            • All I want to destroy is the wheel that has rolled over rich and poor.
            • I have been to hell and back, and I want you to know how I got there.
